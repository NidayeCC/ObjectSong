Conditions:

1) By using this software, you are agreeing to be bound by this license agreement without exception.

2) This software is provided without any warranty whatsoever, and is  delivered "as-is".
It may contain errors, ommissions, material defects, security holes, and many other hazards that could
render it unusable by you.  It is up to you to determine the usability of the software and to exercise due diligence
and care when implementing and using the software.  We will not be liable for any damages, real or imagined, tangible 
or intangible, to you or anyone else as a result of the use of ObjectSong software.  You agree to indemnify us
from any and all legal and liability troubles resulting from your use of the software, without exception.

3) All the intellectual property in this software belongs to ObjectSong.  You may copy the software and use it in your
derived works, as long as those works are not sold, or used for commercial gain of any kind.  You may freely copy,
use and derive from the software for private, and non-funded educational purposes.  If you wish to use the software for commercial purposes,
or for funded educational purposes (such as private schools or universities) 
you must obtain written permission from ObjectSong, and you will probably be required to pay for the privilege.
This condition applies even if your commercial use is from a derived work that contains ObjectSong software.

4) You must include this license agreement when you distribute any work that includes the software, even if the work is derived.

5) Failing to read this license agreement does not absolve you from the responsibility to enforce the agreement, and
to be bound by it.  In other words, ignorance is no excuse.  You acknowledge that failing to enforce this agreement and/or
to be bound by it can, and probably will, result in legal action by us.
